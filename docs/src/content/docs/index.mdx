Nostalgist.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to run emulators of retro consoles within web browsers.

:::note
Nostalgist.js **do not** privide any pirated content, like copyrighted ROM files or BIOS files.

## Introduction

With just one line of code like this:
```js
await Nostalgist.nes('super-mario-bros.nes')
```
in a browser, you can launch an emulator to play a game.

Here is an simple live example.

## Motivation
Nostalgist.js is built on top of RetroArch Emscripten builds. Although there is an official [RetroArch's web player](https://web.libretro.com/), and some third-party ones like [webretro](https://binbashbanana.github.io/webretro/), it's still not that easy to use them programmatically.

The purpose of Nostalgist.js is to simplify the process of launching an Emulator in browsers. Given a ROM and a core, the game should be launched without any additional configuration.

## Getting Started
[Getting started here](/guides/getting-started)

## Under the hood
How does Nostalgist.js work? There are several steps while launching an Emulator.

### Step 1
Load the emulator and the ROM.

Nostalgist.js itself doesn't contain any emulators, but it has a resonable default options, so official emulators built with Emscripten and provided by [RetroArch's buildbot](https://buildbot.libretro.com/). It can also load some homebrew games from
[retrobrews](https://retrobrews.github.io/) project without additional configuration.

By default, cores will be loaded via [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) from [retroarch-emscripten-build](https://github.com/arianrhodsandlot/retroarch-emscripten-build) through [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com). Fore example, the fceumm core, an NES emulator, will be loaded from these URLs:
+ https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/arianrhodsandlot/retroarch-emscripten-build@v1.16.0/retroarch/fceumm_libretro.js
+ https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/arianrhodsandlot/retroarch-emscripten-build@v1.16.0/retroarch/fceumm_libretro.wasm

Games from [retrobrews](https://retrobrews.github.io/) are loaded in a similar way too. And of course you can also load all the nessasary contents by yourself.

If you own a server and your ROM files are hosted there, you can also load them by something like:
```js
await Nostalgist.nes('https://your-server.com/roms/super-mario-bros.nes')
```
:::note
Make sure your server have configured the CORS headers properly.

### Step 3
Prepare a virtual file system.

We use [BrowserFS](https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS)'s `MemoryFS` to create a virtual file system.

### Step 4
Launch RetroArch with the virtual file system and the canvas element we specified in the code.
