Nostalgist.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to run emulators of retro consoles like NES and Sega Genesis, within web browsers.

Star Nostalgist.js on GitHub if you like it! This may take you only a few seconds but means a lot for me.

## A Quick Glance

With Nostalgist.js, you can do these things with a retro game.

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Launch" icon="rocket">
		Launch a retro game with RetroArch emulator in a browser
    <div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 4px;">
      Related API:
      [`launch`](/apis/launch)
    </div>
	</Card>
	<Card title="Save & Load" icon="random">
		Save the state of the game, then load it later
    <div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 4px;">
      Related API:
      [`saveState`](/apis/saveState), [`loadState`](/apis/loadState)
    </div>
	</Card>
	<Card title="Customize" icon="setting">
		Customize any RetroArch config before launching
    <div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 4px;">
      Related API:
      [`launch#retroarchconfig`](/apis/launch#retroarchconfig)
    </div>
	</Card>
	<Card title="Hack" icon="puzzle">
		Access low level APIs of Emscripten
    <div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 4px;">
      Related API:
      [`launch`](/apis/launch)
    </div>
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

With just one line of code like this:
```js
await Nostalgist.nes('super-mario-bros.nes')
```
in a browser, you can launch an emulator to play a game.

Here is a simple live example, though it's no *Super Mario Bros*.

## Motivation
Nostalgist.js is built on top of RetroArch Emscripten builds. Although there is an official [RetroArch's web player](https://web.libretro.com/), and some third-party ones like [webretro](https://binbashbanana.github.io/webretro/), it's still not that easy to launch RetroArch in a browser programmatically.

The purpose of Nostalgist.js is to simplify the process of launching an emulator  to play a game, via RetroArch, in browsers. Given a ROM and a core, the game should be launched without any additional configuration.
