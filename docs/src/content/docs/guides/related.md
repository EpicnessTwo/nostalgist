## Showcases
+ [Retro Assembly](https://github.com/arianrhodsandlot/retro-assembly)

  A web app with which you can build a custom retro gaming library inside your browser. It's built on top of Nostalgist.js.

## Alternatives
+ [EmulatorJS](https://emulatorjs.org/)

  Another JavaScript library for emulation inside browsers.

  It's more powerful and more sophisticated. It has many custom cores and has a friendly user interface. It can be used inside mobile browsers with touch support.

  It's not that friendly towards modern frontend development.
