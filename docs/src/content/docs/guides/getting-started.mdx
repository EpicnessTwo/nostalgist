## Try it online
If you want to take a quick look at Nostalgist.js, it's recommended to use some online editor to give it a try.

### Stackblitz
You can try Nostalgist.js in Stackblitz.
<iframe style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 2/1;" frameborder="none" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-phxocr?ctl=1&embed=1&file=index.js&hideNavigation=1&view=preview" ></iframe>

## Build something more complex
If you want to use Nostialgist.js to build something cool, here are some choices to import it into your project.

### Use a package manager
If you are building a modern frontend project, you can use npm or its alternatives to install it to your project.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh
  npm i nostalgist
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh
  yarn add nostalgist
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh
  pnpm i nostalgist
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
  ```sh
  bun i nostalgist
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then you can import it and start hacking.
```js
import { Nostalgist } from 'nostalgist'

await Nostalgist.nes('flappybird')
```

### Use a CDN
Simplely add a script tag with a CDN link to your HTML.
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/nostalgist"></script>
```

Then you can use the global variable `Nostalgist` in your code and start hacking.
```js
await Nostalgist.nes('flappybird')
```
